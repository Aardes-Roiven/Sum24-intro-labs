# Commit signing.

## Commit signing is crucial for verifying the integrity and authenticity of commits in a version control system like Git. Here are some key reasons why commit signing is important:

1. Integrity: Commit signing ensures that the commit has not been tampered with since it was created. By signing a commit, the author guarantees that the content of the commit has not been altered by anyone else.

2. Authenticity: Commit signing provides a way to verify the identity of the author of the commit. It proves that the commit was indeed made by the person who claims to have made it.

3. Non-repudiation: With commit signing, the author cannot later deny having made a particular commit. The digital signature attached to the commit serves as proof of authorship.

4. Security: Commit signing adds an extra layer of security to the version control system. It helps prevent unauthorized changes to the codebase and ensures that only trusted individuals can make verified commits.

5. Trust: By using commit signing, collaborators can have more trust in the commits they are working with. They can be confident that the code changes are legitimate and come from trusted sources.
