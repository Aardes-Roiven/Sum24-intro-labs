# Commit signing.

## Commit signing is crucial for verifying the integrity and authenticity of commits in a version control system like Git. Here are some key reasons why commit signing is important:

1. Integrity: Commit signing ensures that the commit has not been tampered with since it was created. By signing a commit, the author guarantees that the content of the commit has not been altered by anyone else.

2. Authenticity: Commit signing provides a way to verify the identity of the author of the commit. It proves that the commit was indeed made by the person who claims to have made it.

3. Non-repudiation: With commit signing, the author cannot later deny having made a particular commit. The digital signature attached to the commit serves as proof of authorship.

4. Security: Commit signing adds an extra layer of security to the version control system. It helps prevent unauthorized changes to the codebase and ensures that only trusted individuals can make verified commits.

5. Trust: By using commit signing, collaborators can have more trust in the commits they are working with. They can be confident that the code changes are legitimate and come from trusted sources.

## Merge strategies

### Standard Merge:
- Description: Combines two branches by creating a merge commit that preserves the entire history of changes.
- Pros: Maintains a clear history of changes, keeps track of individual contributions, and is simple to execute.
- Cons: Can result in a cluttered commit history with numerous merge commits.

### Squash and Merge:
- Description: Combines all commits from a feature branch into a single commit before merging, creating a cleaner history.
- Pros: Produces a cleaner commit history, easier to read, and avoids cluttering the history with minor commits.
- Cons: Loses granularity of individual changes, making it harder to track down specific changes or issues.

### Rebase and Merge:
- Description: Reapplies commits from a feature branch onto the base branch, rewriting the commit history.
- Pros: Results in a linear and cleaner history, avoids unnecessary merge commits, and can help resolve conflicts earlier.
- Cons: Rewriting history can lead to potential conflicts, might cause confusion if used incorrectly, and can be more complex for new users.

### Why Standard Merge is often preferred in collaborative environments:
Standard merge is often preferred in collaborative environments because it preserves the entire history of changes made by individual contributors. This transparency helps in tracking down issues, understanding the evolution of the codebase, and giving proper credit to each contributor. It also simplifies the process for new team members to understand the project's history and facilitates easier collaboration among team members.
