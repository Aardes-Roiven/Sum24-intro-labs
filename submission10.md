# Lab 10

## Task 1

To identify and document the most popular artifact registries in AWS, GCP, and Azure, I will start by researching the respective services offered by each cloud provider. Here are some popular artifact registries in each platform:

### AWS Artifact Registries:
- **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**:
  - Secure and scalable container image registry.
  - Integrates seamlessly with Amazon ECS, EKS, and Docker CLI.
  - Supports private container image repositories.
  
- **AWS CodeArtifact**:
  - Fully managed software package repository service.
  - Supports popular package formats like npm, Maven, PyPI, and others.
  - Provides centralized management of dependencies.

### GCP Artifact Registries:
- **Google Container Registry (GCR)**:
  - Managed Docker container image storage.
  - Integrates well with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and other Google Cloud services.
  - Supports private container image repositories.

- **Google Cloud Storage**:
  - Not specifically an artifact registry but widely used for storing various types of artifacts.
  - Scalable object storage with strong consistency and global edge-caching.

### Azure Artifact Registries:
- **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**:
  - Private Docker container registry that supports Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and other Azure services.
  - Integrates with Azure DevOps for CI/CD pipelines.
  - Provides geo-replication for faster container pulls.

- **Azure Artifacts**:
  - Universal package repository for hosting NuGet, npm, Maven, and other packages.
  - Supports multiple feeds for organizing packages and artifacts.
  - Integrates with Azure Pipelines for artifact management.
